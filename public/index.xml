      <description>Hacking Education Philosophy lives in dialogue and our networked world offers many free and open ways of enagaging in dialogue. Networked doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to mean free, though as we all know in the age of monetized data streams. But some minor hacking skills can help keep it free for us all. That&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;ll see in my work past, present and future.

      <description>Our currently interesting times are also very instructive, if only we can find the willingness to heed this instruction. As in other critical moments we are faced with a stark choice: do we acknowledge the full gravity of our situation? This would mean opening our imaginations to some pretty horrifying scenes &amp;ndash; hospitals overflowing again in more places than earlier this year, many more long term illnesses among us and premature death for thousands more of our friends, neighbors and family members.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone,
This is my official first blog post and I have been hemming and hawing a bit about what I&amp;rsquo;d like to write about. I probably won&amp;rsquo;t get very far with this but at least I&amp;rsquo;ll use it to mention a few things that I have been thinking about lately and that I might take the time to pursue a bit further. In no particular order, here are some things that have been on my mind.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m George Matthews &amp;ndash; welcome to my blog! I am a philosophy professor who also likes to mess around with websites, which I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly used for classes I teach. I have finally decided to create my own website. You&amp;rsquo;ll find here some things I have been working on lately in connection with courses I teach, and maybe if I can sit still long enough, occasional blog posts. Check out my CV.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is all pretty self-explanatory &amp;ndash; these are some slideshows, produced once again with xaringan and R-Studio and open for reuse and remixing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
