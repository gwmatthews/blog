      <description>Hi everyone,
This is my official first blog post and I have been hemming and hawing a bit about what I&amp;rsquo;d like to write about. I probably won&amp;rsquo;t get very far with this but at least I&amp;rsquo;ll use it to mention a few things that I have been thinking about lately and that I might take the time to pursue a bit further. In no particular order, here are some things that have been on my mind.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m George Matthews &amp;ndash; welcome to my blog! I am a philosophy professor who also likes to mess around with websites, which I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly used for classes I teach. I have finally decided to create my own website. You&amp;rsquo;ll find here some things I have been working on lately in connection with courses I teach, and maybe if I can sit still long enough, occasional blog posts.
This site is built with a static site generator called hugo which takes a collection of pages written basically as text files and turns them into a full-fledged website.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is all pretty self-explanatory &amp;ndash; these are some slideshows, produced once again with xaringan and R-Studio and open for reuse and remixing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
