            <description>Hi everyone,
This is my official first blog post and I have been hemming and hawing a bit about what I&amp;rsquo;d like to write about. I probably won&amp;rsquo;t get very far with this but at least I&amp;rsquo;ll use it to mention a few things that I have been thinking about lately and that I might take the time to pursue a bit further. In no particular order, here are some things that have been on my mind.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>This is my official first blog post and I have been hemming and hawing a bit about what I&rsquo;d like to write about. I probably won&rsquo;t get very far with this but at least I&rsquo;ll use it to mention a few things that I have been thinking about lately and that I might take the time to pursue a bit further. In no particular order, here are some things that have been on my mind.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>code.</strong> I confess to being endlessly fascinated by code. I am finally learning javascript for real, but have spent much time over the last twenty years bashing code around in one way or another &ndash; HTML, css, linux, bash scripting, Makefiles, WordPress, B2Evolution, LaTeX, and more recently markdown, hugo, and a little bit of MongoDB. Maybe I&rsquo;ll do more than sample these and gain enough knowledge to shift directions and actually become a web developer. But then I&rsquo;d have to get a real job. Maybe I&rsquo;ll just take a taste here and there and marvel at the sheer complexity of the symbolic systems us humans have created in the last three quarters of a century. Anyway, that&rsquo;s one topic I&rsquo;d like to explore here.</li>
<li><strong>mental templates.</strong> Along with my obsession with the programmatic ways in which we communicate with the logic machines that have taken over our lives has been a parallel obsession with understanding things like political ideology, religious belief, and even rote, everyday conversation. We all seem to be following mental templates most of the time and rarely even notice this. It seems to me that most of the time, most people are not actually doing any real thinking at all, at least if thinking involves deliberately following thoughts explicitly, stringing ideas together in a way that respects logic, or at least associative strength. And even more, most people believe that they are really thinking for themselves and NOT just following formulas. What gives?</li>
<li><strong>embodied intelligence.</strong> Why is it that our intelligence is so different than that of the machines I have been talking about so far? It seems to me that a large part of the answer has to do with the fact that our minds are just as much in our bodies as in our heads, operating according to the physical, emotional and kinaesthetic constraints imposed on us by our bodily configurations. And in addition our minds are just as much outside of our heads and bodies as they are inside, inextricable bound up with the real languages, social codes, templates and constraints of our lives together and the stories we share not just about each other, but about all beings with whom we come in contact.</li>
</ol>

<p>Well this is getting a bit carried way. There&rsquo;s is so much to explore and speculate on, and I&rsquo;ll write more when I am feeling more focus. So much for a first post. May it be buried under many more and forgotten as just another throw away blog post in the vast heap of human generated verbiage.</p>
