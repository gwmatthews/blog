<p>I&rsquo;m George Matthews &ndash; welcome to my blog! I am a philosophy professor who also likes to mess around with websites, which I&rsquo;ve mostly used for classes I teach. I have finally decided to create my own website. You&rsquo;ll find here some things I have been working on lately in connection with courses I teach, and maybe if I can sit still long enough, occasional blog posts.</p>

<p>This site is built with a static site generator called <code>hugo</code> which takes a collection of pages written basically as text files and turns them into a full-fledged website. I am still figuring out how to use it, so please forgive me any technical glitches, or better yet, tell me so I can fix them!</p>
