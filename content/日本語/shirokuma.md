This classic, mildly absurdist anime series centered on a cafe run by a polar bear has been a big part of my language immersion strategy. As part of this effort I extracted the audio into small chunks and combined it with Japanese subtitles so you can get a combination of listening and reading practice in your browser where a tool like [Yomichan](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/) or [ichi.moe](https://ichi.moe/) can be used to look up kanji or grammar that you don't know.
