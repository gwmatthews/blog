Wanikani has been a great way to study the kanji. What is also great about it, is the open data framework that it employs, enabling anyone who joins to get access to a huge data set of kanji, readings, meanings, mnenomics, levels in WK, JLPT, JOYO, etc.
This data can be used for all kinds of purposes -- I have used it as input for various projects including:

- A mini [kanji dictionary](kanji-book.html), with kanji sorted by the main onyomi.
- A set of [writing practice sheets](writing-pratice.html). Actually multiple sets, with different sized practice boxes, organized by WaniKani level and JLPT level.
- [Vocbulary study sheets](vocabulary.html), organized by WaniKani Level.
