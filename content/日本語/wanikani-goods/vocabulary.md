Wanikani uses a structured repetition system as the backbone of its approach to teaching the kanji. To help reinforce the readings it also has a ton of vocabulary to learn. To help me keep track of this vocubulary and get some extra reading practice I have created some printable vocabulary sheets. Think of these as cheat sheets or study aids rather than as flashcards.
