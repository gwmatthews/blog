This started out as an attempt to sort kanji by readings and ended up as a handbound reference book with all of the wanikani kanji, sorted by the first mostly onyomi reading.

There are two ways to print these. 

- As full sized sheets to be bound on the long edge. Printed with [plain font](/pdf/WK-kanji-1-60-plain.pdf) or with the [stroke order font](/pdf/WK-kanji-1-60-strokes.pdf).
- As smaller pages to be printed in signatures and bound in a book using any number of hand binding techniques. I used coptic stitch as explained in the video below and these intructions worked perfectly for signatures of sixteen which ends up as stacks of four sheets each folded in half.
