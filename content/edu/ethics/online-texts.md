Here are a couple of projects I have been working on in the last few years. <!--more--> The first is the latest version of an online text I use in ethics classes which has now matured enough in my view to warrant broader release than just .pdf files of lecture notes distributed directly to students. Collaborators and/or peer reviewers and commentators are welcome. You'll see way to do that at the end of each chapter in the text. Likewise with the second -- it is freely available for comment as well as remixing and adapting to your own ethics teaching needs.

[Philosophical Ethics: a guidebook for beginners](https://gwmatthews.github.io/ethics/): a free, open source online and printable introductory ethics text.
