These are the latest iteration of online teaching materials for a distance learning ethics course I have been teaching for the last (*gasp!!*) 20 years. <!--more--> They were written in markdown with the wonderful [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package for [R-Studio](https://rstudio.com/) created by Yi Hui. There was a bit of a learning curve involved in learning how to build them but this approach to slideshows enables clean, accessible and, ultimately, easy to produce html files that are mobile friendly as well and that have auto-generated .pdf screen and print versions as well. Super-geeky, yes. Entirely open source, too! They are intended as somewhat self-contained tutorials on the major topics I typically cover in an online ethics class. 

Feel free to use them in your own classes and if you do, or have editorial or other suggestions by all means open up [an issue in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/gwmatthews/ethics-slideshows/issues) where the code resides. You can navigate through each by clicking within its window and then using the arrow keys. Or you can follow the link below to open each in a new tab.

### 1. Introduction

What is philosophical ethics and how does it differ from other approaches?

### 2. A Little Logic

Philosophy is all about arguments. By "arguments" we mean not so much an acrimonious debate or verbal fight, but a structured and deliberate attempt to establish the truth of the claims we are making. We do this by making our assumptions and the reasoning we are relying on explicit, so all can see whether or not we really have a basis for the claims we are making. This next slideshow explores the basics of logical reasoning.

### 3. Fallacies and Biases

Logical reasoning is difficult. This slideshow explores some of the major bumps in the road as we trying  
to be a bit more logical.

### 4. Relativsm

Many of us start out with the view that ethical principles are in the eyes of the beholder, and maybe this is because all of us start out learning ethical principles by imitating those around us. Is this all there is to ethics? This slideshow presents reasons to think it is not.

### 5. Ethics and Religion

Religion clearly expresses ethical claims. But does that mean that ethics is *based* on religion? And how might that even work? This slideshow examines two of the major contenders for providing a religious foundation for ethics.

### 6. Egoism

Are the cynics right? Is ethics simply unrealistic because human beings are fundamentally selfish? Are the defenders of capitalism right? Is direct concern with others ultimately counterproductive? Find out here.

### 7. Social Contract Theory

Maybe ethical rules really do have a solid rationale -- having **some** rules seems to be necessary for living together in relative peace an harmony. Maybe, that is, even purely self-interested rational agents would accept at least a basis set of moral principles. This is the basic claim of social contract theory, which we examine in this slideshow.

### 8. Utilitarianism

What it means to do the right thing, may not be an obscure as it seems. After all, isn't the point of ethics to bring about the best possible outcomes in an uncertain world where we all face choices? Utilitarianism approaches the question this way and develops a full-fledged ethical theory on the basis of the idea that doing what is right just is doing what is good.

### 9. Kant's Ethics of Duty

Last but not least we have Kantian ethics, which is the attempt to show how it is that moral and ethical rules are universal and binding on all rational agents. That is, Kant claims that there is a rational basis for the concept of rights. His slideshow examines Kant's main arguments.
