These are the latest iteration of online teaching materials for a distance learning ethics course I have been teaching for the last (*gasp!!*) 20 years. <!--more--> They were written in markdown with the wonderful [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package for [R-Studio](https://rstudio.com/) created by Yi Hui. There was a bit of a learning curve involved in learning how to build them but this approach to slideshows enables clean, accessible and, ultimately, easy to produce html files that are mobile friendly as well and that have auto-generated .pdf screen and print versions as well. Super-geeky, yes. Entirely open source, too! They are intended as somewhat self-contained tutorials on the major topics I typically cover in an online ethics class. 

Feel free to use them in your own classes and if you do, or have editorial or other suggestions by all means open up [an issue in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/gwmatthews/ethics-slideshows/issues) where the code resides. You can navigate through each by clicking within its window and then using the arrow keys. Or you can follow the link below to open each in a new tab.

### 1. Introduction

What is philosophical ethics and how does it differ from other approaches?

### 2. A Little Logic

Philosophy is all about arguments. By "arguments" we mean not so much an acrimonious debate or verbal fight, but a structured and deliberate attempt to establish the truth of the claims we are making. We do this by making our assumptions and the reasoning we are relying on explicit, so all can see whether or not we really have a basis for the claims we are making. This next slideshow explores the basics of logical reasoning.
