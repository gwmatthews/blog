I've been teaching Ethics courses online at the Pennsylvania College of Technology for about twenty years. <!--more--> In this time I have developed and refined some resources to help my students think more clearly and critically ethics in theory and in practice. These include a couple of free online texts and a series of slide show tutorials. There is much more that can be added to what what I have here -- on non-Western approaches, feminism and ethics, contemporary attempts to "naturalize" ethics, as well as more on topics in applied ethics. Slowly but surely I'll be extending this material to include some of what seems to be missing. If you like to contribute, [get in touch on Github](https://github.com/gwmatthews), which is where the code for all of this resides.
