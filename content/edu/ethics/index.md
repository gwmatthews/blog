I've been teaching Ethics courses online at the Pennsylvania College of Technology for about twenty years. <!--more--> Over the years I have developed and refined and hopefully improved some resources to help my students think about more clearly about philosophical ethics. The include a couple of free online texts and a series of slide show tutorials intended to explicate the basic approaches. THere is much more that can be added here -- on non-Western approaches, feminism and ethics, contemporary attempts to "naturalize" ethics, as well as topics in applied ethics. Slowly but surely I'll be extending this material to include some of what seems to be missing. If you like to contribute, [get in touch on Github](https://github.com/gwmatthews), which is where the code for all of this resides.
