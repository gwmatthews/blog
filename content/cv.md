## Hacking Education

Philosophy lives in dialogue. Our networked world offers many free and open ways of enagaging in dialogue. Networked doesn't have to mean free, of course, as we all know in the age of monetized data streams. But some minor coding skills and a willingness to poke around under the digital hood can help keep it free and open for us all. That's what you'll see in my work past, present and future - open source!
