## Hacking Education

Philosophy lives in dialogue and our networked world offers many free and open ways of enagaging in dialogue. Networked doesn't have to mean free, though as we all know in the age of monetized data streams. But some minor hacking skills can help keep it free for us all. That's what you'll see in my work past, present and future.
