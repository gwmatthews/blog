I'm George Matthews -- welcome to my blog! I am a philosophy professor who also likes to mess around with websites, which I've mostly used for classes I teach. I have finally decided to create my own website. You'll find here some things I have been working on lately in connection with courses I teach, and maybe if I can sit still long enough, occasional blog posts. Check out [my CV](../cv/index.html).

This site is built with a static site generator called `hugo` which takes a collection of pages written basically as text files and turns them into a full-fledged website. I am still figuring out how to use it, so please forgive me any technical glitches, or better yet, tell me so I can fix them! 

Thanks for visiting and feel free to leave comments below.
