I'm George William Matthews -- welcome to my blog! Here you'll find mostly materials I use in philosophy courses I teach, but then maybe I'll start actually writing some blog posts that I have been wanting to write. This blog is built with the static website generator `hugo` which, if you are not familiar with static site generators, is a program that takes a collection of text files and automagically turns them into webpages so you don't have to slog through all of the html code yourself. Maybe soon I'll put together a blog post on how to use hugo. In the meantime Mike Dane, over at [Giraffe Academy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvmINlrza7JHB1zkIOuXEbw) has a great series of videos explaining how to use hugo.
